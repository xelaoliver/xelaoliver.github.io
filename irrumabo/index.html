                        "Aliquando, nos veterem penitus vivificamus." - Ethan Law <p>
                            In the 1930's, Mother Miriam, a nun who is secretly in a satanic cult called the Order of the Second Death, performs a ritual giving herself the titular Second Death that opens a portal to hell in her face.

                            <br><br>

                            She passes several newborns through the portal until a tiny hand reaches out, they pull a baby out of the hole and name it Gary Miller. You may be under the impression that he is a normal human being like you and me. He is not. A common theory is that he is actually the human incarnation of the demon Astaroth, the duke of Hell (an actual figure in demonology).

                            <br><br>

                            Miriam's goal was to become a vessel for the Unspeakable, likely the devil itself, to pass into our world. However she was too old and weak to do so, so she took it upon herself to raise Gary, who became the leader of the Order of the Second Death.

                            <br><br>

                            Years pass and Gary grows the cult to be a major part of the Sterling CT community, with plenty of important facilities under his belt to spread his influence. A private maternity clinic, daycare, apartment buildings, etc.

                            <br><br>

                            Fast forward to the '80's.

                            <br><br>

                            Every member in the Martin family has some sort of experience with/influence from the occult. Some time in 1980 Cindy Martin miscarries her twins Nate and Jason, and is completely unable to cope, living a lie fantasizing about raising the boys. Her husband Bob plays along, organizing fake birthdays, keeping a room for them, etc.

                            <br><br>

                            Bob, a missionary, inadvertently introduces her to occult ideas/rituals to make the boys real. She is unsuccessful, but this situation may have ended up introducing Amy to Gary Miller. Amy starts volunteering at Gary's clinic, but her parents feel uncomfortable with this. Whether it's because of their growing relationship, or supernatural occurrences surrounding the clinic. At this point Amy is not allowed to volunteer at the clinic anymore.

                            <br><br>

                            Gary reaches out to Amy, inviting her to a work party, which she sneaks out to. There, she is initiated into Gary's cult, and ends up on her parents doorstep, drugged by the cult, now open to demon possession.

                            <br><br>

                            September 1986:

                            <br><br>

                            Father John Ward accompanies Father Allred to the Martin family home to exorcise Amy. They fail and Amy kills everyone but John, who escapes.

                            <br><br>

                            Summer 1987
                            
                            <br><br>

                            Father Garcia, a catholic priest, is tasked with the exorcism of Michael Davies. Michael is in his custody for around a month until the church decides to return him to his parents, paying them to keep quiet about the whole situation. Michael escapes and Garcia pursues him.

                            <br><br>

                            Meanwhile the cult performs the ritual of the Second Death on Amy in the Martin family basement, making her body into a portal to hell.

                            <br><br>

                            Since the exorcism, John is continually plagued by nightmares, and ends up leaving the church (or he may have been excommunicated). On the one year anniversary of the failed exorcism he sets out to the Martin family home to finish what he started. He is somewhat successful and also ends up killing Michael Davies, who lurks in the woods outside the Martin home. Father Garcia takes notice and ends up contacting John about the cult. The two of them write back and forth, collaborating on their investigations.

                            <br><br>

                            They discover the Order of the Second Death, and that Gary aims to summon a demon named Malphas.
                            
                            <br><br>

                            John, who was also caught up in Cindy's delusions, believes that the Martin twins are a part of this ritual, and that they need to rescue them from Gary before the Profane Sabbath, the day that the summoning will happen.

                            <br><br>

                            John and Garcia spend the days leading to the Profane Sabbath searching for clues about the boys and Gary's cult. During this time (assuming you get the true ending) John undoes various seals, and rescues Lisa, a friend of his who was set to be the next vessel for the Second Death.

                            <br><br>

                            October 30 1987

                            <br><br>

                            John discovers the Cults base underneath a daycare run by Gary, which has been indoctrinating its children. He enters, and all sorts of stuff happens to him. Gary injects him with a drug that primes his body for the Unspeakable.

                            <br><br>

                            October 31 1987 - The Profane Sabbath

                            <br><br>

                            Gary reveals that the boys were a distraction for John, and that Malphas has already been summoned. His plan was to assemble his Unholy Trinity, which consists of himself (Astaroth), Malphas, and the Unspeakable to bring about the end of the world.

                            <br><br>

                            Because John had thwarted him in the past, he is now without a proper vessel for the Unspeakable, forcing him to resort to use Mother Miriam's corpse as the vessel. The trinity comes together forming the Antichrist, and John (with the help of divine intervention) stops them, burning Miriam's body.

                            <br><br>

                            Amy appears and the Unspeakable reaches out, dragging Gary back to Hell. Amy, now mostly free of demonic influence, asks John to finish what he started and put her to rest. He finishes the exorcism and her body crumbles to nothing.

                            <br><br>

                            John and Garcia ride off to the sunrise together, ready to fight more demons.
